#Welcome

This site is a collection of foundational documents describing the operation and governance of the open-source EPANET initiative. EPANET is a public-domain pressurized hydraulic pipe network simulation engine.

For other resources, see below:

- The EPANET source code and project are hosted on GitHub. To download the software, create a bug report, contribute your code or ideas, or complain about the feature set, go here: [github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET)
- The user and developer forums are hosted on the OWA discussion site in a special "EPANET" category. To ask a question about using the software or how the software implements engineering principles, or to connect with the developer community, go here: [community.wateranalytics.org](http://community.wateranalytics.org)
- Open Water Analytics (OWA) is the home of several other software projects related to engineering analysis in the water/wastewater industries: [github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics)

####STEERING COMMITTEE

An initial Steering Committee was formed to oversee the creation of the EPANET Open Source project, liaise with stakeholders, represent the project to the water distribution systems community and act as a sounding board for the PMC. Members of the Steering Committee have no direct functions or powers in the governance structure, except as individual members of one of the normal governance categories.

The initial Steering Committee is made up of the ASCE-EWRI Water Distribution Systems Analysis (WDSA) Standing Committee chair and prominent members of the WDSA community from across the globe. The chair of the Project Management Committee is an ad-hoc member of the initial Steering Committee.

The initial Steering Committee will develop and propose bylaws, receive community input and put them into action to solidify the project structure and governance, including the role and makeup of a permanent Steering Committee (should there be a need for this).
