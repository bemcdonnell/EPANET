#Statement of Purpose

The purpose of the Open Source EPANET project is to develop a modern, stable simulation engine for pressurized water distribution system networks.

#Contributing

There are many ways to contribute. You could choose to contribute code, ideas, expertise, documentation, testing, or participate in any of a host of intangible "awareness raising" activities.

How (or if) one contributes code to the open-source EPANET project does not depend on one's standing within the community. All code contributions simply follow a few rules:

- pull requests must be associated with milestones.
- all contributions must pass unit and regression tests; significant divergence from canonical simulation output must be explainable and necessary.
- all contributions must be released to the public domain.
