**Q:** I have developed a new state-of-the-art leak detection algorithm which uses EPANET, will my code go into the open source EPANET project?

**A:** Algorithms which use the EPANET engine are better kept outside the core source code even though they could be made public as open source. However, if your algorithm requires some new hooks to tap into the EPANET engine these function may be added to the core code.
